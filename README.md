# Project 2019 - Programming and Scripting
## Introduction

This document contains my research and investigation of the Iris Data Set. 

## Getting Started

I have created a GitHub Repository where you can access my project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves. See link https://github.com/pcaulfie/pands-project

## Iris Flower Data Set - Overview / Short Summary
### What is the Iris Flower Data Set
The Iris Flower Data Set also known as Fisher's or Andersons Data Set is a database containing the measurements of three related species of Iris; Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica (University of California, Irvine 1988).  
The data set is a record of the measurements taken from a sample of fifty flowers from each of the three species. The variables measured are; sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Fisher (1936) outlines how the data set could be used to illustrate a model which could be used to identify patterns in the data which could be used for in the classification of items in a population.
The data was recorded by botanist Edgar Andersen (Anderson, Edgar 1936). 
### Who is Ronald Fisher

## Data Set
### What does the file contain
e.g. 50 rows x 3 species = 150 rows
Petal Lenghth, Petal Width, Sepa Lenghth, Sepa Width,
### What do each of the columns look like
#### Statistical Properties
One is easy to seperate, 2 are not
#### Insert Table

## Investigation of the Data Set

### Read in the csv file - preferably via url 
### Summarize Data
#### Max, Min, Mean, Standard Deviation
#### Research other ways to summarize the data set
#### include Charts & Graphs
#### Investigation of Python Packages using data set in their tutorials
#### Pandas - e.g scatter diagrams 
### Summary of Investigation at beginning or end?
